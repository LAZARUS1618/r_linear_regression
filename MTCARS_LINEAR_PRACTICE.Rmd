```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasets)
data("mtcars")
```

```{r}
mtcars
```
Create Model 1. 
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(data = mtcars, mpg ~ wt + gear) 
summary(mod1)
```
Create Model 2.
```{r}
mod2 <- lm(data = mtcars, mpg ~ wt + vs) 
summary(mod2)
```
Compare the two models. 
Model 2 appears to be a better fit model however because vs is a less signifficant predictor, It may be better to exclude vs as an independent variable.
